## Purpose

There are a lot of free interactive color wheels out there. They all seem to be targetted at artists and designers though.

However, when working on a web app, it can be combersome to visualize how the colors work to gether, then tweek them, and then put them into a CSS file. Especially for developers who are more concerned with the code behind the app, and working with colors simply gets in the way of that work.

So I built this color wheel with the developer in mind. It outputs variables for both Less and Sass, that can be pasted into what ever project you're working on.
